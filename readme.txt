C# GPA Calculator:
This C# program calculates the Grade Point Average (GPA) based on provided course grades and credits for a fictional student.

Overview:
This project uses C# and the .NET Framework to demonstrate basic calculations of a student's GPA. 

This is a console application that showcases:
-Declaration and assignment of string and integer variables for student information, course names, credits, and grades.
-Calculation of total credit hours and grade points based on credit and grade values for each course.
-GPA calculation using the accumulated grade points and credit hours.

Running the Program:
Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# environment.
Locate and run the Program.cs file.
The program will display the student's details, course grades, credit hours, and the final GPA in the console.

Code Overview:
Variables: String variables store student and course information, while integer variables hold credit and grade values.
Calculations: Total credit hours and grade points are calculated by summing individual course credits and grade point products.
GPA Calculation: The GPA is computed using the accumulated grade points and total credit hours.
Output: Console output shows student information, course grades, and the final calculated GPA.

Development Notes
Created using Visual Studio's .NET IDE while training on FreeCodeCamp.org in persuit of the Foundational C# with Microsoft crtification.
This project was part of practicing C# fundamentals and utilized concepts like variable declaration, arithmetic operations, and string interpolation.
